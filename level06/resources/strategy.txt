- There is a level06.php script and a level06 binary file inside the home folder of level06.
- The php script contains a regex with a deprecated syntax /e:$a = preg_replace("/([x (.*)])/e", "y("\2")", $a);
- This line replace any element contained inside "[x ...]" by the content of a file passed as a parameter.
- Thanks of the /e, the text obtained will be interpreted as php code.
- Using the syntax {${function()}}, we can execute a function inside the string.
- So we create a file /tmp/l06 containing the following text to execute getflag :
        [x {${exec(getflag)}}]

- We then  execute this line to get the flag:./level06 /tmp/l06
