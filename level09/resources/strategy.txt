- Again, we found a level09 executable binary and a token file which was readable this time
- We tried to understand what level09 did and realized it applied a shift to every character in a given string (depending on the index)
- We implemented the reverse version of this program by substracting the index to every character instead of adding it
- We gave the token file to our program, which gave us the flag user's passwordxxxx
