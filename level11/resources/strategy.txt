- This level is quite similar to something we've already done
- We have a lua script that takes a password string, hashes it and does other stuff which are not important to us
- The script is listening on port 5151, so we reached it thanks to telnet and provided it a password:
        telnet localhost 5151
        Password: ;getflag > /tmp/11.txt
- The provided password ended the echo command with the semi colon, and executed getflag in a file, so its output doesn't get piped to the hashing algo
- All that's left to do is:
        cat /tmp/11.txt
