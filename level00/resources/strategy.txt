We watched the intra video of the project to see the readme of the project,
which, for some reason, is not present is this version...

We found the only file with rights for user flag00 in the file system
using the command:  find / -user flag00 -readable 2>/dev/null

This file, named "john", contained a string that looked very much like
a Cesar coded password : cdiiddwpgswtgt

We used dcode.fr and got the final flag ( <- 11)
