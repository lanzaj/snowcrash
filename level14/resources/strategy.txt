- Seeing there was nothing of interest in the home folder, we decided to check on Slack if there were any clues
- We saw messages advising us to check executables
- After a few moments of research and thinking we realised that we had never checked what getflag actually decided
- So we downloaded the executable with scp, gave it to dogbolt to make it more readable in C

- We realised that it contained all the crypted flags, including the one from level 13, and the same ft_des hardcoded function
- All we had to do was give the last crypted flag and give it to the copy program we made for level 13.
