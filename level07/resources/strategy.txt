- Similar to level 03, we saw a binary executable file executable with flag07 user privilege
- We tried to analyse the program by using the disassemble mode of GDB and the command strings.
- We noticed a few things:
    - The program calls getenv and asprintf to get an env variable and format it before giving it to system()
    - The string given as argument to system() is "/bin/echo %s", %s being the string formatted by asprintf, result of getenv
    - Also, we noticed that the default output of the program was "level07", which correspond to 2 env variables: $USER and $LOGNAME
    - When modifying the value of $LOGNAME, the program's output changes

- All that was left to do is : export LOGNAME='`getflag`'
- Run the program again
