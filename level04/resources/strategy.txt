- We did "ls" at the home folder of the level04
- We saw a level04.pl perl script that belongs to flag04 user, and execuable as flag04

- We saw that the script was a CGI script that could take 1 argument (x), so we decided to exploit that with a shell injection
- We made a curl request on the script with the provided port, using the semi-colon url code (%3B) to execute echo, and then getflag as flag04 user:
            curl "http://localhost:4747/level04.pl?x=%3Bgetflag"
